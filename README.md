# AntiAFK
## About AntiAFK
AntiAFK is a [BentoBox](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/BentoBox) addon designed to prevent farming and fishing actions while AFK. It utilizes Minecraft's hunger mechanic to limit block breaking and fishing, which are the most common ways of earning income on SkyBlock servers. The way it limits these actions is by checking a player's hunger level, and if it's below a certain level, it prohibits them from doing the actions described above.
## Installation
### Requirements
* Java 16 or higher
* BentoBox 1.16.6 or higher
### Recommendations
AntiAFK is designed for and works best in pair with a minigame addon, which can be found and downloaded from [BentoBox's GitHub page](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld).
### Installation procedure
Simply drop the .jar file from the Releases page into the BentoBox/addons folder. After a restart or an addon reload, you will be able to modify the addon's configuration file, which is located in the BentoBox/addons/AntiAFK folder. The configuration file is dynamic and is saved when the server shuts down or the addon reloads.
## Contributions
AntiAFK is my very first BentoBox addon, so all contributions that can improve upon the concept of the plugin are appreciated. The best way to contribute is via [pull requests](https://github.com/therealdgrew/AntiAFK/pulls). However, if you just want to report a bug or suggest a feature, then head over to the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/therealdgrew/AntiAFK/issues).
